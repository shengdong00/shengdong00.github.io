本次阅读的三篇文献都是蜂学方面的新进展。我主要关心的是两方面问题：昆虫生理和行为特征的指标及测量方式（研究方法），以及熊蜂在环境胁迫下的反应机制（研究结论）。

Glass, J. R., Burnett, N. P., Combes, S. A., Weisman, E., Helbling, A., & Harrison, J. F. (2024). Flying, nectar-loaded honey bees conserve water and improve heat tolerance by reducing wingbeat frequency and metabolic heat production. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, *121*(4), e2311025121. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2311025121

* Focus on heat wave effects on honeybees
* Honeybees avoid overheating by **lowering wingbeat frequency**
  * Reducing metabolic heat production is the result of lowering wingbeat frequency. Should not be mentioned separately as two mechanisms here.


> "Many flying insects generate aerodynamic force by using a combination of mechanisms, including the sweeping motion of the wing (i.e., **wing translation**) and by creation of **rotational vortices** when the wings rotate before reversing direction. Insects that fly with a large **stroke amplitude** generate the bulk of their force from the wing translation phase, while those that fly with a small stroke amplitude primarily generate significant forces during wing rotation."

* To measure metabolic rate, they put individual bees in a chamber and sent air flow through the chamber. Evaporation and metabolic levels were measured by comparing the amount of H~2~O and C~2~O at the entrance and the exit of the chamber.
* Flight muscle temperature is detected by inserting a micropobe into the center of the throax <sub>ouch!</sub> and then recording temperature data.

Kazenel, M. R., Wright, K. W., Griswold, T., Whitney, K. D., & Rudgers, J. A. (2024). Heat and desiccation tolerances predict bee abundance under climate change. *Nature*. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07241-2

* 16 years of abundance patterns for a hyper-diverse bee assemblage in a warming and drying region

* Link bee declines with experimentally determined heat and desiccation tolerances, and use climate sensitivity models to project bee communities into the future.

* Model prediction results

  * More homogeneous communities dominated by drought-tolerant taxa
  * Larger-bodied bees also dominated under intermediate to high aridity

* > "Climate studies have largely focused on geographical or phenological shifts, particularly potential phenological mismatches between bees and plants, often finding that mismatches are unlikely"

* A smart index: the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), which integrates temperature and precipitation

* What climate change scenarios? During 2020–2100 for three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios representing low, moderate and extreme climate change

* **Climate sensitivity functions (CSFs)** describe how an organism’s abundance tracks the distribution of a climate variable (mean and variance).

Vaudo, A. D., Dyer, L. A., & Leonard, A. S. (2024). Pollen nutrition structures bee and plant community interactions. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, *121*(3), e2317228120. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2317228120

* Asked how pollen nutrition (relative protein and lipid content) sampled from 109 co-flowering plant species structured visitation patterns observed among 75 subgenera of pollen-collecting bees in the Great Basin/Eastern Sierra region (USA).
* Important concept: **nutritional niches**
* Bee–flower visitation data across eight sites in the Great Basin/Eastern Sierra region; combined with flower collection, nutrition analysis etc.
